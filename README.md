# Auro Tutor - Task 2 Submission

Hey everyone! This is my submission for the second task assigned by Auro as part of the hiring process. The goal here is to analyze the existing Auro Tutor, identify key issues, and propose a comprehensive plan to improve it.

## 🔍 Feature Analysis - Improving Auro Tutor
### Selected Feature: **Auro Tutor** (Reading Section)

Auro Tutor is a key feature in Auro.Edu, designed to assist learners in understanding course material. However, the current implementation has major limitations that hinder its effectiveness. My proposed improvements focus on making the tutor more context-aware and interactive, ensuring a smoother and more intuitive learning experience.

### 🚀 Proposed Improvements
1. **Persistent Tutor Access** – The Auro Tutor should be available at all times within the reading module, accessible via a floating icon.
2. **Deep Content Understanding** – The Tutor should leverage Generative AI (LLM + RAG) to process and understand the full reading material.
3. **Text Highlight & Copy** – Users should be able to highlight text for instant explanations and have the option to copy content for better note-taking.
4. **Smart Contextual Responses** – Instead of generic answers, the Tutor should generate detailed responses based on highlighted text and previous interactions.
5. **Conversational Memory** – The Tutor should remember past queries within a session, allowing for a natural, multi-turn conversation.
