# Auro Tutor - Task 2 Submission

Hey everyone! This is my submission for the second task assigned by Auro as part of the hiring process. The goal here is to analyze the existing Auro Tutor, identify key issues, and propose a comprehensive plan to improve it.

## 🔍 Current State - Detailed Error Analysis
Right now, Auro Tutor is supposed to be an AI-powered learning assistant, but it has some major limitations that make it frustrating to use. Here's a breakdown of the key issues:

### 🎥 Video Module Issues
1. **Lack of Temporal Context** – The Tutor doesn’t understand questions tied to specific timestamps (e.g., "What was said at 2:30?").
2. **Transcript Ignorance** – It can't answer questions based on the video's exact words or concepts, even if they are directly mentioned.

### 📖 Reading Module Issues
3. **Content Unawareness** – The Tutor cannot process the reading material, making it useless for answering content-specific questions.
4. **Copy Restriction** – Users can’t copy text, which makes note-taking and research difficult.

### 🃏 Flashcard Module Issues
5. **Superficial Understanding** – Answers are too basic, lacking depth and real-world applications.

### ❓ Quiz Module Issues
6. **Pre-Answer Help Limitation** – The Tutor doesn’t provide guidance before users submit an answer.
7. **Post-Answer Explanation Absence** – It only shows whether an answer is right or wrong without explaining why.
8. **Inaccurate "Weak Concepts" Detection** – The "Revision Plan" is generic and doesn’t truly reflect user weaknesses.

### ⚙️ General Issues (Affecting All Modules)
9. **No Free-Form Input** – Users can’t type their own questions freely.
10. **Loss of Conversational Context** – The Tutor forgets previous interactions, making multi-turn conversations ineffective.
11. **Keyword Reliance** – Responses are based on keyword matching rather than true comprehension.

All of these issues make learning with Auro Tutor more frustrating than helpful. Right now, it’s more of a keyword-matching bot than an intelligent learning assistant. Let’s fix that.

### 🔑 Key Improvements

2. **Deep Content Understanding** – Using Generative AI (LLM + RAG) to understand video transcripts, reading materials, flashcards, and quizzes.
3. **Personalized Learning** – Tracks user performance and provides tailored feedback.
4. **Natural Language Interaction** – Users can ask questions in plain language with context retained throughout conversations.
5. **Copy Functionality** – Allows users to copy reading materials for easier note-taking.
